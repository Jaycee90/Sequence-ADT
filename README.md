# Sequence-ADT
DATA STRUCT & ALGO
The Assignment

In this assignment, you will implement and test a sequence class (a container ADT) that uses a dynamic array to store its items.

Goal

To gain experience/exposure in specifying, designing and implementing/testing a container ADT. Key concepts/features involved include:
	●	Sequence (traditionally called list) container ADT as one of the classic data structures.
	●	Dynamic array as the underlying data structure.
	●	Iterators implemented as member functions (internal iterators). (QUIZ: Which member functions are they?)
	●	Enhanced scoping (name-conflict prevention) using custom namespace (see Lecture Note 304s01NamespaceInCpp).
	●	Symbolic representation of data type using typedef (see Lecture Note 304s01aAliasingConstant_TypeInCpp).
	●	Use of size_t for sizing/counting/looping. (HELPER: If you are not familiar with size_t, check out this write-up.)
